# Reliable-Sensor-Transmission-Protocol--RSTP-
This coursework allowed me to develop skills in code comprehension and in network socket programming using the JAVA programming language. The aim of this coursework is to build a Reliable Sensor Transmission Protocol (RSTP) that works on top of UDP and guarantees reliable delivery of sensorsâ€™ readings between a client and a server.
